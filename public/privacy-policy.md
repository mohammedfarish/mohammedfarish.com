## Privacy Policy 😎

Last revised on 10 March 2022

## The Gist 📝

Hey there! 👋 So, you're here because you wanna know how I handle your data, right? I get it. The internet can be a wild place 🌐.

> My data isn't even that valuable, so I don't care! 🤷

For real? Is that what most people think? 🤦

Let me break it down for you 🗒️. I'll ask some questions, like I would to an ad company (like Google 🌐), and explain it like you're in fifth grade 👧👦. Just remember, this only applies to my website [www.mohammedfarish.com](/) and nothing else.

---

1. ### Are you tracking me? 🙄🔍

   Okay, I'll be honest: yes, I am. But don't worry! 😅 I really respect your privacy 🔒, and I promise not to cross any lines. My goal is to make your experience on my site as enjoyable as possible 😄, so I try to see things from your perspective. And hey, you can always opt out by scrolling down to the Analytics Settings ⚙️.

2. ### How can you track me? 🤔

   Full disclosure 📣: I'm only collecting your **IP Address** 🌐, **Device** 📱, and **Browser Type** 🌐. Browsers share some info that helps me create a better experience for you, like:

   - Your IP address 🌐
   - Your browser type 🌐
   - Your operating system 💻
   - Your device type 📱
   - Your timezone ⏰
   - Your network location 📶
   - Your device language 🗣️
   - Your screen resolution 🖥️
   - Your screen color depth 🌈
   - Your screen orientation ↔️
   - Your screen size 🔍
   - Your screen pixel density 🎨

     ... and more

   I only use three of these to track and analyze my visitors 📊. The rest? Ignored 🚫. This helps me understand the kind of traffic I get and how I can improve my site.

   Keep in mind that MOST OTHER WEBSITES 🌐 use even more invasive tools to learn things like your age and gender 👩👨. I'm all about privacy 🔒 and consent ✅, so I encourage people to avoid those tools.

   Want to know something super creepy 😱? Some sites use **Browser Fingerprinting** 👆 to identify you, even in incognito mode! VPNs can't save you from that 🚫. To learn more, check out [Robin Linus' Ubercookie Website](https://ubercookie.robinlinus.com/).

3. ### Do you sell or share my data with someone else? 😟

   No way! 🚫 I believe your data is yours and shouldn't be sold or shared 💸. After all, it's a product of your life experiences 🌟.

4. ### What's the data retention period? ⏳

   I keep user data in a secure database 🔒 for up to one year. After that, it gets deleted during an annual cleanup 🗑️.

5. ### Can I see my data? 🤔

   Absolutely! Here's the info I have about you, in full transparency 👀.

{{REPLACEWITHDATA}}

6. ### How do I delete my data from your servers? 🗑️

   Easy peasy! 😊 Just opt out from the tracking by scrolling down to the Analytics Settings ⚙️.

7. ### How do I trust your word for it? 🤨

   Don't just take my word for it – be skeptical! 😇 I'm a big fan of privacy 🔒 and consent ✅, so I've made the [source code of this website](https://github.com/mohammedfarish/mohammedfarish.com) publicly visible for you to verify the authenticity of my claims 🔎.

8. ### How do I contact you? 📧
