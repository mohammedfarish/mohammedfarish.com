# Privacy Policy

Last revised on 10 March 2022

## The Gist

All right, so let me just clear this up. You're here because you're concerned about the way I am going to handle your data. I mean, I can totally understand why. After all, the internet is a crazy cyber-jungle.

> My data is not even that valuable so I just don't care!

Seriously? Is that what most others say? ðŸ¤¦

Here are a few points to help you understand how important your data is, even in the grand scheme of things. The way I plan on doing it is to ask some questions that I would ask an advertisement company, such as Google, and then I'll explain it as if there was a 5th grader listening to me.

Please note that the scope of all the below information is limited to the website [www.mohammedfarish.com](https://www.mohammedfarish.com) and nothing beyond that.

1. ### Are you tracking me? ðŸ™„

   I find this question very challenging, because I'm trying to explain to you that I have no evil intentions while I am walking on the verge. The honest answer is, yes. But I respect your privacy very strongly, so there is a line I have drawn not to cross and invade. It is often my aim to create a positive experience here by imagining myself as if I were in your shoes. But you can acyually opt out of this by scrolling all the way down to Analytics Settings.

2. ### How can you track me? ðŸ¤”

   Okay, full disclosure, I am only collecting your **IP Address**, **Device**, and **Browser Type**. Browsers expose a few parameters that are primarily used to orchestrate the user experience of a website. These include:

   - Your IP address
   - Your browser type
   - Your operating system
   - Your device type
   - Your timezone
   - Your network location
   - Your device language
   - Your screen resolution
   - Your screen colour depth
   - Your screen orientation
   - Your screen size
   - Your screen pixel density

     ... and more

   In my case, I only use three of those parameters to track and analyze my users. Any other parameters are ignored. I can use this to better understand the type of traffic I receive and how I can improve my website.

   It is important to keep in mind that MOST OTHER WEBSITES use various tracking tools to get high precision data such as your gender and age. In general, I discourage my clients from using such tools since I am a strong advocate of privacy and consent.

   But do you know what's one of the most creepiest practices I've seeen others do? They extract a fingerprint of your device, with the above list of parameters to identify you even if you are browsing in incognito mode. If you think all those VPNs could keep you "anonymous", think again, because theses guys are way far ahead of you. It's called **Browser Fingerprinting** and you can actually learn more about it at [Robin Linus' Ubercookie Website](https://ubercookie.robinlinus.com/).

3. ### Do you Sell or Share my Data with someone else? ðŸ˜Ÿ

   Not in my lifetime. I live by this theory about how our data is treated as somebody else's monetary factor, essentially ignoring the hardships and struggles we've endured to become who we are today and to become data itself. The data is a product of our lives and no one other than us should set a price on it.

4. ### What is the data retention period?

   The data of a user is usually stored in a secure database for a maximum of one year. It is then deleted during an annual clearing out of the database.

5. ### Can I see my data? ðŸ¤”

   Please find below what exact information I have about you in complete transparency.

{{REPLACEWITHDATA}}

6. ### How do I delete my data from your servers?

   It's easy! You can opt-out from the tracking by scrolling down to the Analytics Settings.

7. ### How do I trust your word for it?

   You just don't have to take my word for it and that's very good! Always be skeptical. But I am a very strong advocate of privacy and consent and as a part of the advocacy, I have made sure that the [source code of this website](https://github.com/mohammedfarish/mohammedfarish.com) is publicly visible so you can verify the authenticity of my words.

8. ### How do I contact you?
