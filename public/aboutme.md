Hi, I'm **Mohammed Farish**! I'm {{AGE}} and a software engineer based in the United Arab Emirates. This is my personal space on the web where I present my own projects, musings, and other stuff I want the world to know.

There are no ads or affiliate links on my site, no external tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts, and no paywall. This site is solely designed to help me keep track of what I've learned by sharing it with the world and documenting it for myself, and to hopefully connect with some people.

Check out my [projects](/projects) to see a highlight of the open-source projects I've made, and articles to see everything I've written. I've also written external publications for DigitalOcean, Envato Tuts+, etc. and done a few speaking engagements and podcasts, which you can find below.
